# Nrrdio.Ynab

This is an incomplete manual implementation of the [YNAB API v1](https://api.youneedabudget.com/v1). One day I will remove the word "incomplete" from that sentence.

# Why not use Swagger like they recommend?

* Just to prove to myself I can.
* Because I like the latest C# features.
* Because I like completely unencumbered code and want to unlicense this.

The Macross library is unfortunately encumbered by the MIT license, but is necessary due to a bug in how the System.Text.Json library implements enum deserialization. Eventually it will be removed.
